## Compiling

I am compiling it using the built-in system of Intellij. I made it so every folder is a module, so I can add different
dependencies for every one of them. Down below, you'll find information about every module and what dependencies
it should contain:

- main module:

  - v1_8_R3 jar (1.8.8 spigot jar)
   
  - v1_16_R1 jar (1.16.x spigot jar)
      
  - all the libraries from the libs folder (their order shouldn't matter, but it might cause issues).
      
  - the API module.

- API module:

  - v1_8_R1 jar (1.8 spigot jar)

- NMS modules:

  - their matching spigot jar (module v1_8_R1 will get a v1_8_R1 spigot jar, etc)
      
  - the API module.
      
  - the main module.

  v1_8_R1 - Spigot 1.8

  v1_8_R2 - Spigot 1.8.3

  v1_8_R3 - Spigot 1.8.8

If you struggle with finding the correct ones, please open a ticket on the Discord server, so I can help with them.

## Common Issues

• I am getting a missing chunkData error.
  
  This is due to your Spigot 1.8.8 not containing that class. Some of them does contain it, some don't.
