# In this file you can manage all of the upgrades of the server.
#
# Here is some information about the built-in upgrades:
# Crop Growth: Will make your crop grow faster than usual.
# Spawner Rates: Will make your spawners spawn faster than usual.
# Mob Drops: Will make your entities drop more items than usual.
# Hoppers Limit: Will limit the amount of hoppers in your island.
#
# Here is an example of how to create a custom upgrade:
# upgrades:
#   upgrade-name:                     // Custom name for your upgrade. Will be used as an identifier for the upgrade (also in commands)
#     '1':                            // The level of the upgrade. Level 1 is the default one. Make sure you add ''.
#       price: 100.0                  // The price for ranking up to the next upgrade.
#       commands:                     // A list of commands to be executed from console. Use %player% for player's name.
#       - 'give %player% diamond 1'
#       - 'island admin setupgrade %player% upgrade-name 2'     // You need to execute this command manually.
#     '2':
#       price: 0.0
#       commands:
#       - 'island admin msg %player% &cReached maximum level!'  // If you don't call the setupgrade command, it's like the player didn't level up.
